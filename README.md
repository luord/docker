A basic docker image allowing to run both python3 and nodejs as a regular user (not root)

_DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION_

This image is meant to be used for prototyping only.

**If used beyond a prototype or running in a CI, it's better to copy/clone this Dockerfile and pin the python and node versions**

That way potential errors by version disparity are prevented.
